# Corona Times Online
http://coronatimes.online/

This project was assembled at the 2020 Hack CEWIT Hackathon by [Ian Matlak](https://github.com/mnai), [Julian Hecker](https://github.com/julian-hecker), and [Philip Guerrero](https://github.com/guerpc). 


## Summary
Corona Times Online aims to provide awareness to users about the 2020 Corona Virus outbreak, live data and updates about its spread, and what one can do to prevent getting sick.

The app gets live data by scraping sites that are reporting on cases of Corona Virus, and organizes it into an easy to digest dashboard complete with map, statistics, and table.

There is a section to subscribe for updates about Coronavirus in one's own home country, a page with information about the virus, as well as a questionnaire which can help determine if a person is at risk for the virus and what they can do if they are.
